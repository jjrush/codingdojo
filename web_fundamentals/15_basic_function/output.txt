I guessed function 9's output incorrectly cause I incremented the index along with the +2 and printed them together so I guessed 3, 6, 9 instead of 2, 5, 8, 11.

Output for 1
35

Output for 2
8

Output for 3
6

Output for 4
3
9

Output for 5
40

Output for 6
4

Output for 7
10 3
30

Output for 8
3
4

Output for 9
2
5
8
11

Output for 10
Prints 0 to 10 for a(0,10)
Then prints 0 to 10 again as well as the return which is 0 (10 * 0)

0
1
2
...
9
0
1
2
...
9
0

Output for 11
Assuming it was called (which it doesn't look like it gets called), it would print the below:
0
1
2
...
9
0    <- "i"
0
1
...
9
1    <- "i"
0
1
...
9   
And so forth until "i" is 10


Output for 12
Again, this function is seemingly not called but were it the output would be:
0 0
0 1
0 2
...
0 9
10 0
1 0
1 1
1 2
...
1 9
10 1
Adn so on until "i" is 10
9 0
9 1
9 2
...
9 9
10 9

Output for 13
10

Output for 14
15
10

Output for 15
